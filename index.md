# Happy rEx*ing*!

[WSO2 Identity Server](https://wso2.com/identity-and-access-management/) is 100% open source!. The product maintains the source code under two GitHub organizations: [wso2](https://github.com/wso2) and [wso2-extensions](https://github.com/wso2-extensions). These two GitHub organizations carry code related to all WSO2 products, with hundreds of repositories. Sometimes it's hard to find, which jar file comes from which repo. We built rEx to address that concern.

## Setup

Step-1: The tool relies on Docker, so make sure you have Docker running in your local environment.

Step-2: Copy rex.sh to a directory where you want to maintain Identity Server git repositories. Alway better to keep this readonly. 
```markdown
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prabath/wso2is-repo-explorer/master/rex.sh
chmod +x rex.sh
```
Also please make sure that you have Internet access, while running the tool. To run the tool with no Internet connection, after the first run, set the REX_ONLONE environment variable to false. The **clone**, **list**, **update**, **update-index** functions are not availble for the offline mode. By defeault REX_ONLONE is set to true - and **the tool to function you must run it at least once in the online mode**.
```markdown
export REX_ONLINE=false
```
By default the output on the console is in color. Sometimes when you want to redirect the output to a file, it is useful to remove color. Set the REX_COLOR environment variable to false to turn off color.

```markdown
export REX_COLOR=false
```
## Updates

There are three components need to be updated. The rex.sh - will have minimal updates. Any changes to the core of the tool would require updating the Docker image. The indexes will get updated every four hours.

The tool will detect all the updates and will automatically install them (only if the tool is running under online mode).

```markdown
Last indexed at Tue Jun 2 13:39:15 PDT 2020
```
The following command updates metadata related to all Identity Server repos. Usually you do not need to do it manually, as the tool detects any new updates and automatically updates the indexes.

```markdown
./rex.sh update-index
```

## Usage 

### Repository Operations 

Clones all Identity Server related repositories. This is not a required step to run other commands.

```markdown
./rex.sh clone
```
Lists out all Identity Server related repositories. You can do this, even without cloning all repos.

```markdown
./rex.sh list
```
Updates all Identity Server related repositories. If there are any new repos, those will be cloned. 

```markdown
./rex.sh update
```
### Search Operations 

Finds the git repo(s), by the given name. You can do this, even without cloning all repos. The -c option will narrow down the search results for the given component name (or jar file name without version)

```markdown
./rex.sh find org.wso2.carbon.identity.authenticator.mutualssl
```

```markdown
./rex.sh find -c org.wso2.carbon.identity.authenticator.mutualssl
```

```markdown
./rex.sh find OAuth2TokenValidator
```

```markdown
./rex.sh find OAuth2TokenValidator.java
```

```markdown
./rex.sh find samlsso
```
### Product Updates (Patches) 

**The product updates are provided via WSO2 Update Manager ([WUM](https://wso2.com/updates/wum)). These updates are not open source and provided only to the WSO2 customers and trial users. This tool does not provide any updates - but simply uses the publicly available metadata via the WUM tool to generate some useful information.**
